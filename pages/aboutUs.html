            <h2>Software Developer & Group Glue</h2>
            <p>After years in the food-and-hospitality industry, I've decided to pivot into software development to pursue my passion of being constantly challenged and encouraged to learn new skills. My previous work experience has given me the ability to identify problems and their solutions quickly and accurately in high-pressure situations. I also believe that my extensive experience in customer service positions me to work with clients, identify and anticipate their needs, and build applications and interfaces that are focused on customer satisfaction and approachability.</p>

            <h2>Software Developer & Idea Woman</h2>
            <p>While a solid manager in my previous roles, I've decided to make the leap into software development to give myself a new challenge and to contribute to the betterment of society through technology by building online bridges among people. With my strong background in customer service, I am in touch with users' and clients' needs. I love tech because it allows me to see an array of what people do, why they do it, and how they go about it. With that information I can make customers' connections personal and implement technologies efficiently for their needs.</p>

            <h2>Software Developer & Dictionary</h2>
            <p>I love literature, languages, racket sports, and choral music, but my only real passion lies in adding value. I have operated trips for organizations like Nat Geo and Harvard Alumni to places like Iran, the South Caucasus, and Russia. I have run study-abroad programs for students and teachers of Russian and have worked as a translator, interpreter, editor, and teacher. I’m a client-oriented team player who is always looking for new ways to make old processes better. Whether it’s saving an organization money or increasing its bottom line, I do my work with old-school integrity and a passion for quality.
