        My name is Ameilia Valdes and I am a Software Developer with a background in fine dining service, bartending, and restaurant management. After years in the Food and Hospitality industry, I've decided to pivot into the Software Development field, where I feel I will have the opportunity to pursue my passion of being constantly challenged and encouraged to learn new skills. I believe my previous work experience has given me the ability to identify problems and their solutions quickly and accurately in high pressure situations, and that this ability will lend itself well to software development. I also believe that my extensive experience in customer service will better allow me to work with clients, identify and anticipate their needs, and to build applications and interfaces that are focused towards customer satisfaction and approachability.

        My name is Audrena. I was previously a passionate manager, with a desire to learn and take on more responsibility. That desire led me to software development. 
        I decided to make the leap into software development to give myself a challenge, and create a position where I can help others contribute to the betterment of society through technological advancements, ideas, and techniques. This specific skill would allow me the resources to create bridges online, between users, allowing for the free flow of information and resources. 
        I have a strong customer service background, which has prepared me for meeting user and client needs driven by my passion to help people. The best parts of my day are solving the problems of human emotion and needs. Technology allows me to see an array of what people do, why people do it, and how they go about it. With that information I can make customer connections personal, and implement technologies efficiently for their needs.

        I love literature and languages, racket sports and running, choral music, the piano, and the smell of old books, but my only consistent passion lies in adding real value and doing a thorough, conscientious job. I’m working now to become a post-covid web developer, but in my previous lives I operated trips for companies like Nat Geo and universities like Harvard to places like Iran, Central Asia, the South Caucasus, Russia, and the Baltics. Before that, I ran study-abroad programs for students and teachers of Russian in St. Petersburg, Russia, for nearly a decade; and I’ve worked as a translator, interpreter, editor, teacher, corporate trainer, and teller. I’m a client-oriented team player who is always on the look-out for new ways to make old processes work better. Whether it’s saving an organization money by cutting costs, finding new vendors, or refining a processes; or increasing a bottom line by recruiting new clients, improving a program and its reviews, or introducing new revenue streams, I do my work with old-school integrity and a passion for quality.
