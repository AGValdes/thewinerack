# The Wine Rack

## Vision

This app helps a user select a meal that will pair well with a bottle of wine that they have on hand. Also, exposes the user to additional wine varietals as well as the meal items they pair well with.

If the user has a bottle of wine and would like to prepare a meal that pairs well with it, this app will offer guidance.

People are often gifted bottles of wine and are unaware of how to best enjoy it with food.

## Scope

### In

- User will select a general category of wine followed by a more specific list of wine varietals
- Based on the chosen varietal the user will be prompted with food item categories, each suggesting a few possible specific options
- Upon selection of all food items the user will be presented with a complete meal plan, all of which is paired to the selected wine
- Meal plans are stored in user "wine racks" for future reference


### Out

- This app will never be made available as a android or iPhone app

### Minimum Viable

- At a minimum this app will capture a user's ID so that their personal wine rack can be stored for future use
- Users will be able to select a general category of wine and be presented with an ideal meal plan

### Stretch

- A section will be included in the users wine rack to allow for comments and user notes about prior meal pairings 

- The wine bottles on the home page will be made clickable for the initial wine category selection

- Allow for multiple users to store their data independently base on user name

- Add animated buttons that form drops and fall into the wine glass of the user's initial selection

## Functional Requirements

- A user can enter their name and view their prior pairing selections
- Give the user the option to delete their personal records

### Data Flow

- User enters the site, enters their name, and chooses their category of wine
- Second page is then populated with a list of more specific varietals, based on selection a list of food categories is then appended
- Users then select from a limited list of specific food items from each food category
- All food selections are then presented as a meal plan along with the selected bottle of wine
